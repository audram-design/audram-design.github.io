                    <p class="cardBodyText">
                        One of the most defining experiences in my personal journey has been my time as an endurance athlete. Training 
                        for and competing in endurance events has taught me invaluable lessons about discipline, resilience, and 
                        navigating the unexpected. When you're out on a long course, you can't always predict the challenges; unexpected 
                        weather, fatigue, or an unforeseen obstacle but you learn to adapt, stay focused, and push forward toward the finish line.
                        <br /><br />
                        This mindset has significantly shaped how I approach my professional career. Handling tight deadlines, managing shifting 
                        priorities, or overcoming unforeseen challenges in a project feels a lot like navigating a racecourse. I've learned 
                        to stay calm under pressure, pivot when necessary, and always find a way to cross the finish line, whether that means 
                        collaborating more effectively with my team or putting in the extra effort to ensure success. Endurance sports have 
                        instilled in me the belief that success isn't about avoiding challenges; it's about rising to meet them head-on. This 
                        perspective has not only driven my career forward but has also fueled my passion for tackling ambitious goals and 
                        delivering results.

                        I grew up about 45 minutes outside of Philadelphia and will always be a loyal Philly sports fan; though the 
                        Phillies have my heart. I moved from Pennsylvania to Arizona over a decade ago, and for the past 11 years, 
                        I've called the Tucson area home. I'm still discovering new trails, restaurants, and entertainment spots here, 
                        which keeps life in the desert exciting.

                        I first met Remy while volunteering at our local animal shelter. My husband and I would spend one morning a 
                        week walking or running with the dogs, giving them a break from their kennels. It was always hard not to get 
                        attached to the long-term residents, but after a few outings with Remy, I knew he was meant to be ours.

                    <p>
                        Today, Remy is 11 years old, and I can't imagine life without him. He's my special boy, my loyal protector, 
                        and the source of more joy than I can possibly put into words.
